# Quick Start


# Install on your computer (optional)

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to do all this magic. If you are familiar with git,
then you may want to install GitHub Pages (with Jekyll) on your computer. So
you will be able to edit your pages locally (e.g.  when you are offline) and
view your site locally before publishing.

For example to install on Mac run this command:

```
gem install github-pages
```

Then clone your repository and run Jekyll locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io
cd USERNAME.github.io
jekyll serve -w
```

While Jekyll is running, open <http://localhost:4000/> in your browser. Your
site should be there. You can add and edit pages and Jekyll will automatically
regenerate HTML files, just reload the page in the browser to see changes.
